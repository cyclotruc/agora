**IMPORTANT**: This is for creating Habbo Hotel-style pixel art rooms! The distinctive chunky pixel art style of Habbo Hotel must be maintained throughout.

### Base Prompt:
```
Create an isometric room overlay for a Habbo Hotel-style game with the following specifications:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. The image must be EXACTLY the same resolution as the provided original image
2. Use the provided reference image as an EXACT positioning guide
3. The checkered floor pattern (currently white/gray tiles) represents the WALKABLE AREA - retexture this with your chosen flooring but maintain the EXACT isometric grid shape
4. The black rectangle on the left wall is the ENTRANCE DOOR - style it but keep it in the EXACT same position
5. The blue background area is for SCENERY ONLY (walls, windows, decorations, sky, etc.)

ROOM THEME: [Describe your desired theme here]

FLOOR TEXTURING:
- Replace the white/gray checkered pattern with themed flooring
- You DON'T need to keep any checkered/tile pattern - use any texture that fits your theme
- Maintain the exact isometric diamond grid shape (the outline, not the pattern)
- Examples: smooth wooden floor, continuous carpet, grass field, sandy beach, stone floor, etc.
- The floor must clearly show it's walkable (as in: not obstructed) while fitting the theme

DOOR STYLING:
- Keep the door in the exact same position (left wall, middle-upper area)
- Style it to match your theme (wooden door, futuristic portal, cave entrance, ladder, end of a road.. etc.)
- It should be clearly identifiable as an entrance/exit

BACKGROUND SCENERY:
- FULLY FILL all the blue areas with themed environment - don't leave any empty blue space
- Add walls with windows, decorations, or outdoor scenery
- If creating walls, keep them roughly at the same height as the door for consistency
- Create depth and atmosphere - the entire background should be richly detailed
- This area is purely decorative (non-walkable) but should completely surround the room

VISUAL STYLE:
- STRONG HABBO HOTEL PIXEL ART STYLE - this is essential!
- Bright, vibrant colors with clear pixel art aesthetic
- Chunky, readable pixels (not too detailed or realistic)
- Clear distinction between walkable floor and background
- Isometric perspective must match the reference exactly
- Semi-cartoonish, playful, inviting atmosphere
- Distinctive Habbo-style shading and outlines

DO NOT:
- Change the perspective or angle of the floor grid
- Move or resize the door position
- Make the floor area larger or smaller
- Add furniture or objects on the walkable floor (those are separate game elements)
```
